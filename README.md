# World Energy Statistics (1980 - 2022)

An interactive data dashboard meticulously designed to analyze comprehensive energy datasets from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and International Energy Agency (IEA), offering deep insights into fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. This dynamic tool enables users to track and compare energy consumption and production trends, while also highlighting CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. By combining powerful visualizations with real-time data analysis, the dashboard provides a clear and actionable understanding of the global and national energy landscape, driving informed decision-making for sustainable energy strategies.




## Microsoft Power BI

I developed the dashboard using a combination of DAX coding and Power Query to create a highly interactive and insightful data visualization tool. By leveraging DAX, I crafted complex measures and calculations to analyze key metrics such as energy consumption, production, and CO2 emissions across various sources like fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear, and renewable energy. Power Query was instrumental in transforming and cleaning the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and International Energy Agency (IEA), ensuring a seamless integration of multiple datasets. This powerful combination allowed me to build a dynamic dashboard that provides users with actionable insights into energy trends and emissions.
